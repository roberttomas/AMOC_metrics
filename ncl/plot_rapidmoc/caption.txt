The Atlantic overturning circulation (Sv) at 26.5 deg N calculated using the Roberts (2013) code applied to
3 POP integrations and Rapid obervational estimates (black - solid).  The code calculates the circulation 
using a methodology that approximates the same used in the Rapid array (short dashed) and using model 
velocities (long dashed).  Shown are decadal means from high-resolution (HR - red) and 
low-resolution (LR - blue) forced and a fully coupled high-resolution (ASD - green) simulations.  
The forcing used for HR and LR is from JRA55, years 2000-2009 and the period for the obserations overlaps 
the last 6 years of this decade.  The forced simulations are both weaker than the observations and this 
partly attributable to the fact that they were both spun up from rest, whereas the the ASD simulation
was started from WOCE climatology.
